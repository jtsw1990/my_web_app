          <p>"Neural Networks" and "Deep Learning" have become quite the
            buzzwords nowadays, even within more traditional industries like
            insurance. However, ask any Actuary what's the most commonly used model
            he/she uses, and it is unlikely you'll hear any answer other than GLMs or
            GBMs.</p>

          <h2>What is a Neural Network?</h2>

          <p>A neural network, as cool as it sounds, is nothing more than a statistical
            model. Much like its older brother - The simple linear regressor, the
            neural network also uses parameters and optimization to construct a
            line-of-best-fit for whatever data it is being presented. Unlike its old
            brother however, it is modelled from the way biological neural networks in
            our brains process information.</p>
